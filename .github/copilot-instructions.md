# Self-Healing Microservices Project Instructions

This project demonstrates advanced microservices patterns including:
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents cascading failures by monitoring service health
- **Bulkhead Pattern**: Isolates resources to prevent failure propagation
- **Auto-Recovery Pattern**: Implements automatic healing and retry mechanisms

## Key Architectural Patterns:
1. Use modern JavaScript/Node.js with async/await patterns
2. Implement proper error handling and logging
3. Follow microservices best practices with clear separation of concerns
4. Use dependency injection for better testability
5. Implement comprehensive monitoring and health checks

## Code Style:
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use configuration-driven approach for pattern parameters
- Include detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Testing:
- Write unit tests for all pattern implementations
- Include integration tests for service interactions
- Simulate failure scenarios for pattern validation
